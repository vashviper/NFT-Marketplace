# NFT Marketplace

This repository contains the code for a basic NFT Marketplace built using Solidity and JavaScript. The marketplace allows users to buy and sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain.
This code is based on the NFT Marketplace tutorial at [Build your own NFT Marketplace from Scratch](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/) built by [alchemy.com](https://alchemy.com)

## Features

### 1. Create and Mint NFTs

Users can create and mint their own unique NFTs using the provided Solidity contract. The contract includes functions to define the metadata and ownership of each NFT.

### 2. Buy and Sell NFTs

The marketplace enables users to buy and sell NFTs using Ethereum. Users can browse the available NFTs, view their details, and make purchases using their Ethereum wallet.

### 3. Ownership and Transfer

The Solidity contract ensures secure ownership and transfer of NFTs. Each NFT has a unique identifier and can only be owned by one address at a time. Users can transfer their NFTs to other addresses securely.

### 4. Metadata and Description

The NFTs in the marketplace can have associated metadata and descriptions. This allows users to provide additional information about their NFTs, such as title, description, image, and other relevant details.

### 5. Ethereum Integration

The marketplace integrates with the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to interact with the marketplace using their Ethereum wallets. This ensures transparency, immutability, and security of transactions.

## Smart Contract

The smart contract used in this marketplace is written in Solidity, a programming language specifically designed for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract includes functions for creating, minting, buying, selling, and transferring NFTs.

The contract also includes event logging to track important actions and changes within the marketplace. This provides transparency and auditability of the marketplace operations.

For more details on the smart contract implementation, please refer to the [contract code](/path/to/smart-contract.sol) in this repository.
